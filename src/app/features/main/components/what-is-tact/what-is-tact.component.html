    <h3>Tact and FunC</h3>
    <span>
      FunC is a thin and direct wrapper around Fift that allows precise control over execution code.
      Tact offers a similarly direct execution model and brings powerful abstractions on top of it
      to improve clarity and safety of complex smart contracts.

    <h3>Rich types</h3>
    <span>
      Familiar syntax and strong types compatible with TL-B. Arithmetic is always safe because
      integers have precise bounds. Tact helps you to perform necessary checks without silent
      failures or unexpected truncation.

    <h3>Actor-oriented</h3>
    <span> Strongly-typed messages and well-organized handlers. </span>

    <h3>Gas safety</h3>
    <span>
      Tact makes writing and auditing multi-contract systems easier by offering first-class gas
      commitments and types. Compiler knows cost of execution of each portion of the code.
